The agile software development emphasizes on four core values.

1. Individual and team interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan


Advantages:
- Cope better with change/feedback
- Increase the quality of our deliverables
- Better idea of the estimated time/work left
- Tighter control over the development process. 


- SCRUM

![Scrum](https://www.guru99.com/images/11-2014/agile_Processesv1_4.png)

1. Scrum Master
Master is responsible for setting up the team, sprint meeting and removes obstacles to progress

2. Product owner
The Product Owner creates product backlog, prioritizes the backlog and is responsible for the delivery of the functionality at each iteration

3. Scrum Team
Team manages its own work and organizes the work to complete the sprint or cycle


## Product Backlog

This is a repository where requirements are tracked with details on the no of requirements(user stories) to be completed for each release. It should be maintained and prioritized by Product Owner, and it should be distributed to the scrum team. Team can also request for a new requirement addition or modification or deletion



## Pair programming:

**"Two heads think better than one"**

Advantages:
- Increases the quality
- Helps with overwork or burnout
- Support and mutual learning
- Share context and knowledge


Types:
- Ping pong (TDD)
- Driver vs Navigator


## Set up group projects:

- Build the core skeleton together.
- Don't become owners of a part of the app.
- push and merge often.
- Communication is key.
- Once the base is there, split tasks and begin.
- Have fun, build something a little bit crazy.
